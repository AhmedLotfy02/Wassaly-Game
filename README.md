an exciting and addictive game where players embark on a thrilling adventure as a pizza enthusiast 🍕. The objective is to navigate through a bustling city, collecting a specified number of pizzas within a limited time frame.


## Gameplay overview🎮

Players begin the game with five batteries 🔋, each representing the available energy for their car. As time progresses, the batteries gradually deplete, causing the car's speed to decrease📉. The player must collect additional batteries scattered throughout the city to maintain their speed and prevent it from dropping too low.

The game also features three power-ups 🔌 that players can utilize to their advantage. When activated, these power-ups temporarily boost the car's speed.

However, players must exercise caution as collisions with other cars or buildings can lead to penalties. When colliding with another car💥, the game ends, and players must restart the level. Colliding with buildings 🌇 results in reduced visibility, making it more challenging to spot and collect pizzas.

The game sets the challenge of collecting 9️⃣ pizzas within the designated time limit. Failing to collect all nine pizzas before reaching the end point results in a level failure.

### Controls:

- **A**: Move left
- **D**: Move right
- **Shift**: Increase the speed of crafting
